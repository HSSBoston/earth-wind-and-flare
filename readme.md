We are a team of 4 students who participated in the 2022 NASA Space Apps Challenge:

- Hanna Suzuki
- Yuto Yashiro
- Akari Takekawa
- Kurumi Kamio

NASA Space Apps Challenge is an annual hackathon event (or an innovation incubation and civic engagement program) where NASA puts out about 30 challenges for participants around the world to develop innovative solutions.

<!--
Our team worked on the Webb Origami Design Challenge to "create origami artwork that looks like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and showcase Webb as a technological and design marvel using an “arts-meet-science” approach." We built computerized origami models for JWST, which use hexagonal tessellation and other folding techniques to model JWST's mirrors and sunshield. Our models are equipped with Raspberry Pi computers, cameras, sensors and Kintone cloud database, so they work as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Our goal is to have our models do what the real telescope does (such as taking pictures, tracking the current position, measuring sunlight intensity and temperature) .

This web site provides instruction videos, circuit diagrams, software setup guide and ready-to-run programs. You can immediately learn how to reproduce our origami crafts and IoT telescope models. We hope you find this project interesting and useful and then learn something about JWST. JWST has not been launched yet. Let's get to know about it and watch its launch and deployment at December 25!
